# Welcome to Onnatank!

Onnatank is a simple web based tool that allows a user to enter their vehicle's information as well as a location to see how far they can travel "On(n)-a-tank" of gas. Once this information is entered, Onnatank displays a Google Maps frame to display a radius, as well as multiple tiles listing information of gas stations that are within the radius.
